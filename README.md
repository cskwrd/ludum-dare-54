## How to play

**Start (get your dinos out of the base):** You need to roll one of the following combinations (1-6), (1-1), (2-2), (3-3), (4-4), (5-5) and (6-6). Whenever you roll any of these combinations, you get to roll again.

**Move:** Generally, dinos move a number equal to the sum of the dice. There are a few exceptions.

- For double combination 1 or 6, the sum of the dice is used.
- For double combinations 2 to 5, the individual die value is used. For example, if double 2’s are rolled, one dino can move 2 spaces. If double 5’s are rolled, a single dino can move 5 spaces.
- When moving a dino down the **Home** stretch, all combinations other than doubles are 0 spaces, and all doubles combinations are 1 space. 

**Kick (send your opponents back to their base):** You can kick your opponent when the distance between you and your opponent equals the dice result.
For example, you are 6 steps from your opponent in front of you, you roll a 4 & 2, you can kick that dino back to its start location.
Dinos traveling down the home stretch are safe and cannot be kicked back to start by an opponent.

**Block (being blocked by you or your opponent):**

- If there is an opponent dino standing in front of you and the distance is smaller than your dice result, you are blocked. In this case, you must move other dinos or lose the turn.
- Your dino cannot get out of the base when there is a dino (either your team or your opponent) standing at your **Start** location.
- At any place on the board, you can never jump over other dinos. 

**Go home:** When your dino completes one round of the board, it now can go home.

- To win the game, you need to be the first player who brings all the dinos back home in the order of 6, 5, 4, 3 (move up one at a time, no going over).
